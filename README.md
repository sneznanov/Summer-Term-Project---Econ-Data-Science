# Summer-Term-Project---Econ-Data-Science
Summer Term Project for Econ Data Science

Used machine learning to predict real estate prices using raw data from the city of NYC and kaggle cleaned data for the city of Boston.

Abstract:
Home prices have rocketed to their highest levels in history in the United States (Harrison 2022), as a
result buyers need a tool to best predict the overall cost of their mortgage payment. As the mortgage
payment is split between paying the bank the principal and interest on the loan and paying the
government property taxes, I will attempt to find a model that accurately predicts both the bank’s and
the government’s valuation of a given property. This would be a useful tool for consumers to be able to
have an accurate prediction of their monthly costs once they have purchased a home and would be able
to budget accordingly. I built this tool by using two datasets, one that would be used by the bank and the
other compiled by the government, to select the best machine learning method to predict property
values. After building machine learning models using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest,
and Deep Neural Networks, I found Random Forest to be the best overall model for predicting property
pricing from both a government and market standpoint.
